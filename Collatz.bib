From the heuristical probabilistic approach to the complex mapping of the algorithm, the scientific community has fetched for many methods to try to prove it formally, and thus, mathematicians like Erdos tend to believe that "mathematics are not yet ready for such problems". In this research report, covering domains like algebra and graph theory, it is shown a trial of proof of the conjecture by disproval of its two antitheses: the existence of an ever-growing Syracuse suite and the existence of a cycle different from the cycle 4,2,1.},

We present three cellular automata (CA) that transform the global problem of mimicking the Collatz map in bases 2, 3, and 4 into a local one of transforming the digits of iterates. The CAs streamline computation first by bypassing calculation of certain parts of trajectories: the binary CA bypasses division by two altogether. In addition, they allow for multiple trajectories to be calculated simultaneously, representing both a significant improvement upon existing sequential methods of computing the Collatz map and a demonstration of the efficacy of using a massively parallel approach with cellular automata to tackle iterative problems like the Collatz Conjecture.},

Scenarios are defined as strings of characters "s" (for "spike") and "d" (for "down") which symbolize the Collatz operations (3m+1)/2 and m/2 in a Collatz Series connecting two odd integers, the startnumber and the endnumber. It is shown that a scenario determines uniquely four integers, called startperiod, startphase, endperiod, and endphase such that startnumber = startperiod x k minus startphase, and endnumber = endperiod x k minus endphase, where k is any natural number. Therefore, any scenario can be realized infinitely many times, with well-defined startnumber and endnumber for each realization. It is shown how the periods and phases for a given scenario are calculated. The results are used to prove that any odd (even) number in a Collatz Series is less than 8 (7) ("up"- or "down"-) steps away from an odd integer which is divisible by 3. They are also used for the construction of Collatz Series which exhibit prescribed regular graphics patterns.

For starting numbers of specific residue classes (\$mod{\textbackslash} 12{\textbackslash}cdot2{\textasciicircum}h\$) or (\$mod{\textbackslash} 12{\textbackslash}cdot2{\textasciicircum}\{t+1\}\$) the finite subsequences have the same length \$h,t\$. It is conjectured that for each \$h,t{\textbackslash}geq2\$ the number of all admissible residue classes is given exactly by the Fibonacci sequence. This has been proved for \$2{\textbackslash}leq h,t{\textbackslash}leq50\$. Collatz's conjecture is equivalent to the conjecture that for each \$s{\textbackslash}in{\textbackslash}mathbb\{N\},s{\textgreater}1\$, there exists \$k{\textbackslash}in{\textbackslash}mathbb\{N\}\$ such that \$T{\textasciicircum}k(s){\textless}s\$. The least \$k{\textbackslash}in{\textbackslash}mathbb\{N\}\$ such that \$T{\textasciicircum}k(s){\textless}s\$ is called the stopping time of \$s\$, which we will denote by \${\textbackslash}sigma(s)\$. It is shown that Collatz's conjecture is true, if every starting number \$s{\textbackslash}equiv3,7{\textbackslash} (mod{\textbackslash} 12)\$ have finite stopping time. We denote \${\textbackslash}tau(s)\$ as the number of \$C{\textasciicircum}t(s)\$ until \${\textbackslash}sigma(s)\$ is reached for a starting number \$s{\textbackslash}equiv3,7{\textbackslash} (mod{\textbackslash} 12)\$. Starting numbers of specific residue classes (\$mod{\textbackslash} 3{\textbackslash}cdot2{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}sigma(s)\}\$) have the same stopping times \${\textbackslash}sigma(s)\$ and \${\textbackslash}tau(s)\$. By using \${\textbackslash}tau(s)\$ it is shown that almost all \$s{\textbackslash}equiv3,7{\textbackslash} (mod{\textbackslash} 12)\$ have finite stopping time and statistically two out of three \$s{\textbackslash}equiv3,7{\textbackslash} (mod{\textbackslash} 12)\$ have \${\textbackslash}tau(s)=1\$.

	abstract = {The (3 x +1)/2 problem is generalized into the n -furcation problem ( l i x + m i )/ n where i ?[0, 1, ..., n -1]. It is shown that, under some constraints on l i and m i , the main bijection property between the k less significant digits of the seed, written in base n , and the sequence of generalized parities of the k first iterates is preserved. This property is used to investigate a stochastic treatment of ensemble of large value seeds. The bijection property predicts stochasticity for a number of iterations equals to the number of significant digits of the seed. In fact, the stochastic approach is valid for much larger numbers, a property which is more easily shown by using increasing sequences than decreasing ones. Finally, we extend the stochastic approach to cases where the bijection theorem does not hold, introducing the matrix giving the probability that a {\textquotedblleft} j {\textquotedblright} number (where j is the last significant digit of this number written in base n ) gives a {\textquotedblleft} i {\textquotedblright} number iterate.},
